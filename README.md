# Mentor-AI Toolkit

This repository contains two complementary tools designed to support entrepreneurs and startups in crafting and refining business materials using AI.

## 📁 1. Application Autopopulation Bot

This tool allows users to **paste content from a pitch deck or business plan**, and the bot will attempt to **automatically fill out a set of predefined application questions** using that input. It's ideal for streamlining grant or incubator application processes.

- 🔍 **Input**: Raw business plan or pitch deck text
- 🤖 **Output**: Auto-generated answers to structured application forms
- 🧠 **Goal**: Save time and reduce repetitive manual writing for startup founders

## 📁 2. BusinessFlow Chatbot

This tool provides an **interactive, guided chatbot** that walks users through a structured series of questions and **builds a business plan step-by-step** based on their responses.

- 🗂️ **Uses a LangGraph flow** to manage dialogue and state
- ✍️ **Generates a complete business plan** at the end of the session
- ⚙️ **Includes an Admin Panel** that allows users to modify:
  - Prompts for each question
  - Follow-up prompts
  - Final plan generation logic

This combination of structure and flexibility helps both novice and experienced entrepreneurs shape their ideas with AI assistance.
